          5 Key Lessons You Learn After Building a Software Development Project
        </h2>
        <p class="bodyText">
          Having developed a few full-stack web applications, using
          <a
            href="https://github.com/njogued/ServiceMtaani-Vercel"
            target="_blank"
            >Flask</a
          >,
          <a href="https://github.com/njogued/servlist-web-App" target="_blank"
            >Django</a
          >, and
          <a href="https://github.com/njogued/bookclub" target="_blank"
            >Express</a
          >, I have gained a few insights into the development process that you
          may find helpful. In this article, I will outline five key lessons
          that I have picked up along the way.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subTitle">Lesson #1: Design is paramount</h5>
        <p class="bodyText">
          Proper planning and design are crucial and you should never start a
          project with just the idea in your head. You might think you might
          have everything covered, but more often than not, you will have to
          update your database with new models, add new routes, and include new
          features. These changes may result in increased complexity and derail
          the progress through continuous refactoring of the existing codebase.
          To avoid this, it is crucial to properly plan out the project through
          extensive design. You’ll cross the implementation bridge when you get
          there but at least chart the route to the bridge first. To design a
          full-stack project you can use:
          <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a>, to design
          web pages,
          <a href="https://sqldbm.com/" target="_blank">sqlDBM</a> for SQL
          database design, and
          <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">Lucidchart</a> for UML
          diagramming. The design requirements vary for each project so make
          sure to find out the tools relevant for your project.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subTitle">Lesson #2: Document your code</h5>
        <p class="bodyText">
          You’ve heard them say, “Good code is its own documentation”. While
          this is just an excuse for lazy developers who want to sound like
          god-tier developers, failure to document your code is a disservice not
          only to other developers but to yourself as well. Truth is, you might
          forget why you implemented a certain fix and wonder why that block of
          code is necessary. You’ll then have to read through the entire block
          of code, just to say, “Oh, that’s why” after thirty minutes. Do your
          future self a favor by writing a few lines of documentation after
          implementing the fix.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subTitle">Lesson #3: Test! Test! Test!</h5>
        <p class="bodyText">
          Unit tests and integration tests should always be at the forefront
          when you’re developing. Unit tests ensure the functionality of the
          basic components of your project (units). Unit tests are crucial since
          they ensure early detection of issues, allow you to refactor your code
          while maintaining existing functionalities, and ease the inclusion of
          new features. To test the interaction between various units, you
          should also create integration tests. Depending on your preferred
          language, the tools you use for unit testing will vary. The options
          available include the
          <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"
            target="_blank"
            ><strong>unittest</strong></a
          >
          unit testing framework for Python,
          <a href="https://www.guru99.com/testing-tools.html" target="_blank"
            >Mocha testing suite</a
          >
          for Node JS,
          <a href="https://www.guru99.com/testing-tools.html" target="_blank"
            >JUnit testing framework</a
          >
          for Java,
          <a href="https://www.guru99.com/testing-tools.html" target="_blank"
            >and many more</a
          >. Be sure to find out the tools applicable to your project. Selenium
          and Postman can be used for integration tests but there are many other
          tools available.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subTitle">
          Lesson #4: AI will greatly boost your productivity
        </h5>
        <p class="bodyText">
          With the recent developments in generative AI and the advent and
          popularity of ChatGPT, AI is inescapable. AI-powered tools
          significantly reduce developers' workload, allowing them to focus on
          more creative and complex problem-solving aspects. AI can assist you
          in code formatting, test case generation, and documentation
          generation. By using AI, you will accelerate your learning process,
          become more productive, and AI tools may even improve your code
          quality. AI tools available for software developers include
          <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank"
            >Github Copilot</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/"
            target="_blank"
            >Visual Studio Intellicode</a
          >, and <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>
          Plus[link]. However, overreliance on AI may lead to inaccurate and
          non-functional code, therefore be sure to evaluate and fully
          understand the code generated by AI to see if it meets your
          requirements.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subTitle">
          Lesson #5: Be a bit more flexible with your rigid timelines.
        </h5>
        <p class="bodyText">
          Lastly, you should be open to adjusting your timelines. In a perfect
          world, the developers would meet all the milestones on time, every
          product would be pushed out on time, and developers would not have to
          push back deadlines. Developers and clients alike would be happy.
          However, that is often not the case, and programmers, project
          managers, or clients will often underestimate the time required for
          development. Software development often comes with unexpected
          setbacks. As a programmer you might find that the packages you wanted
          to use are now deprecated or are no longer maintained, you have to
          learn something new. While pushing yourself to meet your deadlines,
          you may suffer from
          <a
            href="https://fellow.app/blog/productivity/engineering-developer-burnout-symptoms-how-to-prevent-it/"
            target="_blank"
            ><strong>‘programmer burnout’</strong></a
          >. While pushing out a product is important, taking care of your
          mental health is more important. As such, you should understand that
          there will always be unexpected challenges and adjust your
          expectations accordingly when you encounter them.
