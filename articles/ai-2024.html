          Top Three AI Technologies and Trends to Look Out For in 2024
        </h2>
        <div class="bodyText">
          Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, generative AI has taken
          the world by storm. While the world of AI continues to evolve, it is
          important to stay up to date with the changes. Here are some of the
          top trends and technologies to look out for in 2024:

        <h5 class="subTitle" id="servlist">Gemini: Google's Answer to GPT-4</h5>
        <div class="bodyText">
          Google has struggled to compete with OpenAI’s GPT-4 model and
          specifically, the ChatGPT conversational service. Although they
          released Bard as a counter, the experimental service has been

            >accused of inaccuracies and hallucinating</a
          >. Google seems to have finally created a worthy competitor to the
          GPT-4, Gemini. Although Gemini has not been released to the public,
          the demo video posted by Google is simply mind-blowing. According to
          Google, Gemini is a “multi-modal model”, meaning that it will not only
          support text but will also support images, audio, and video input.
          According to Google, Gemini has a 90% score in massive multitask
          language understanding, outperforming not only

          >. Is it just hype or will it live up to the expectations? That
          remains to be seen. However, if it lives up to the expectations, it
          could prove revolutionary for the AI field.

          Mobile Integration: AI on the Go
        </h5>
        <div class="bodyText">
          2024 is expected to witness significant strides in the integration of
          artificial intelligence into mobile devices. Apple has been rather
          quiet compared to its competitors but it recently launched MLX, an
          open-source machine-learning framework that would allow developers to

            target="_blank"
            >own large language model (LLM)</a
          >. Apple could likely integrate Generative AI into its devices as from
          next year including an AI-enhanced version of Siri. According to
          <a
            href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23989591/google-gemini-ai-model-pixel-8-pro-recorder-smart-reply"
            target="_blank"
            >The Verge</a
          >, Google Pixel 8 is a pioneer in Generative AI-integrated mobile
          devices offering features such as Smart Reply and auto-summarization.
          These features will be powered by Gemini Nano, the reduced version of
          Gemini that runs on the local device. Since other device manufacturers
          will have to adapt or lose out, we will definitely witness massive
          technological leaps in what our devices can do.

        <h5 class="subTitle">Augmented Working</h5>
        <div class="bodyText">
          Instead of replacing jobs, AI is likely to become a collaborative
          partner in the workforce through increased integration into various
          industries.AI will continue to reshape work and productivity in the
          foreseeable future. AI-driven automation will not only take over
          repetitive tasks but will also assist in complex decision-making as
          has already been witnessed in the healthcare sector. In
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >healthcare</a
          >, generative AI is being used to autonomously design and run
          simulated experiments at scale, leading to greater efficiencies in
          hypothesis testing, model development, and drug discovery. The
          profound impact of AI will reverberate over various functions
          including customer engagement, product development, and business model
          innovation. In 2024, we will also witness further refinement of AI
          models to fit specialized needs such as risk analysis in the financial
          sector and personalized learning in education.

        <h5 class="subTitle">Conclusion</h5>
        <div class="bodyText">
          As these advancements unfold, the ethical use of AI remains a
          paramount concern. Therefore, 2024 could also witness a massive push
          for AI legislation, with the

          in this regard. The year could also bring about some developments in
          artificial generative intelligence (AGI). In summary, 2024 will
          definitely be an interesting year for AI, marked by technological
          breakthroughs.
